/**
 * Interface for selecting key candidates for verifying a JSON Web Signature
 * (JWS) object. Applications should utilise this interface or a similar
 * framework to determine whether a received JWS object (or signed JWT) is
 * eligible for {@link com.nimbusds.jose.JWSVerifier verification} and further
 * processing.
 *
 * <p>The interface supports keys selection based on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Recognised header parameters referencing the key (e.g. {@code kid},
 *         {@code x5t}).
 *     <li>Additional {@link SecurityContext}, if required and set by the
 *         application (e.g. endpoint where the JWS object was received).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>See JSON Web Signature (JWS), Appendix D. Notes on Key Selection for
 * suggestions.
 *
 * <p>For a key selector for signed JWTs that also uses the claims set (e.g.
 * issuer ({@code iss}) claim) see
 * {@link com.nimbusds.jwt.proc.JWTClaimsSetAwareJWSKeySelector}.
 *
 * <p>Possible key types:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link javax.crypto.SecretKey} for HMAC keys.
 *     <li>{@link java.security.interfaces.RSAPublicKey} public RSA keys.
 *     <li>{@link java.security.interfaces.ECPublicKey} public EC keys.
 * </ul>
